# Solution Overview

## Approach
I implemented end-to-end tests for the Student Onboarding workflow, focusing on critical business scenarios such as form validation, successful creation flows, data persistence, and edge cases. The tests were designed using the Page Object Model (POM) pattern to ensure maintainability and scalability.

## Test Scenarios Implemented
1. **Form Validation**: Ensured all required fields are validated, including email format, phone number format, and conditional logic for SMS capability and parental consent.
2. **Successful Creation Flows**:
   - Adult student with minimal data
   - Adult student with complete profile
   - Child student with new family
   - Child student linking to existing family
3. **Data Persistence**: Verified that student data is correctly saved and persists across sessions.
4. **Business Rules**: Tested status transitions (Active → Trial → Waiting), family account creation and linking, default settings application, and billing setup flow.

## Assumptions Made
- The platform's UI elements are accessible and interactable.
- The test environment is stable and mirrors the production environment.

## Challenges Faced
- Handling dynamic elements and ensuring selectors are robust.
- Managing asynchronous operations and ensuring proper synchronization.

## What I Would Do With More Time
- Implement additional edge cases such as handling special characters in names, international phone numbers, and concurrent user creation.
- Enhance reporting capabilities for better test insights.

## Questions for the Team
- Are there any specific performance benchmarks for the onboarding process?
- Is there a preferred method for handling test data cleanup in the staging environment?
