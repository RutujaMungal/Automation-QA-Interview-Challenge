# Solution Overview

## Approach

For this challenge, I focused on testing the **Student Onboarding workflow end-to-end**, emphasizing **business-critical scenarios** rather than UI cosmetic details. My approach combined **risk-based testing** and **state-machine thinking**: I prioritized scenarios that directly impact revenue, compliance, and data integrity.

I used the **Page Object Model (POM)** to make tests maintainable and reusable, paired with factories for dynamic test data. This ensures the tests are scalable for larger data sets (100+ students) and reduces brittle selectors.

Async operations and dynamic page elements were handled using smart waits to avoid flaky tests, and every test cleans up after itself to maintain a stable test environment.

## Test Scenarios Implemented

1. **Form Validation**

   * Required fields validated
   * Email and phone format checks
   * Conditional logic: SMS notifications, parental consent for children

2. **Successful Creation Flows**

   * Adult student with minimal data
   * Adult student with full profile
   * Child student with a new family
   * Child student linked to an existing family

3. **Data Persistence**

   * Verified student appears immediately in listing
   * Ensured all entered data is correct on the Student Details page
   * Confirmed data persists across sessions

4. **Business Rules**

   * Student status transitions: Active → Trial → Waiting
   * Family account creation and linking
   * Default settings applied correctly
   * Billing setup flow validated

## Assumptions Made

* The MyMusicStaff UI elements are stable and accessible.
* Test accounts have the necessary permissions for student creation and deletion.
* Some backend services (e.g., Stripe, SendGrid) are mocked or not fully tested due to sandbox limitations.
* Cleanup is done via UI automation since API access is limited.

---

## Challenges Faced

* Dynamic elements: Some fields appear conditionally based on student type or parent linking.
* Async handling: Ensuring proper waits for network requests and page updates.
* Limited backend access: Forced some assumptions around data cleanup and external integrations.

---

## What I Would Do With More Time

* Add edge cases like **special characters**, **international phone numbers**, and **concurrent student creation**.
* Implement **API-based cleanup** to speed up tests.
* Create more **detailed reporting dashboards** for test execution results and failed scenarios.
* Explore **performance testing** for onboarding workflows under heavy data load.

---

## Questions for the Team

* Are there recommended **performance benchmarks** for onboarding?
* Any preferred approach for **test data cleanup** on staging?
* Should we automate **external integrations** (Stripe, SendGrid) or mock them for all tests?
